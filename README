NAME
    Win32::Security::EFS - Perl interface to functions that assist in
    working with EFS (Encrypted File System) under Windows plattforms.

SYNOPSIS
            use Win32::Security::EFS;
        
            if(Win32::Security::EFS->supported()) {
                    Win32::Security::EFS->encrypt('some/file');
                    Win32::Security::EFS->decrypt('some/file');
            }

DESCRIPTION
    The Encrypted File System, or EFS, was introduced in version 5 of NTFS
    to provide an additional level of security for files and directories. It
    provides cryptographic protection of individual files on NTFS volumes
    using a public-key system. Typically, the access control to file and
    directory objects provided by the Windows security model is sufficient
    to protect unauthorized access to sensitive information. However, if a
    laptop containing sensitive data is lost or stolen, the security
    protection of that data may be compromised. Encrypting the files
    increases security in this scenario.

  METHODS
    supported()
        Returns *true* iff the underlaying filesystem supports EFS

    encrypt($filename)
        The *encrypt* function encrypts a file or directory. All data
        streams in a file are encrypted. All new files created in an
        encrypted directory are encrypted.

    decrypt($filename)
        The *decrypt* function decrypts an encrypted file or directory.
